## 📸 System Interface: A Visual Walkthrough
*We designed this platform to be as intuitive as a smart home dashboard, making complex AI and Cloud operations easy to understand for everyone, from developers to business stakeholders.*

### 1. Secure Access & Authentication
**What it does:** Ensures that only authorized personnel can access and control the core cloud infrastructure.
<br>

### 2. The Operational Hub (The Main Dashboard)
**What it does:** This is the control center. Instead of just showing what is happening *now*, it uses AI to predict what will happen in the *future*. The graphs show the AI predicting CPU, RAM, and Network Traffic spikes before they happen, allowing the system to prepare in advance.

### 3. Catching "Zombie" Servers & Saving Money
**What it does:** Sometimes servers are left running but do no actual work (costing the company money). The **Anomaly Screener** automatically acts as a security guard, finding these idle "zombie" servers and flagging them for termination. The **Watchlist** allows admins to keep a close eye on critical servers.

### 4. AI Intelligence & Automated Scheduling
**What it does:** Shows exactly how smart the AI is (currently at ~97.3% accuracy) and displays a clear timeline of when the system plans to automatically add or remove servers based on predictions.

### 5. FinOps: Tracking The Budget
**What it does:** The ultimate business dashboard. It tracks the current monthly cloud bill and calculates exactly how much money the AI is saving the company compared to traditional, manual server management.
<br>

### 6. Manual Overrides & PDF Reports
**What it does:** Gives human administrators the final say. If needed, they can press an "Emergency Halt" button. It also features a **Report Engine** to export all savings and server activities into clean, professional PDF reports for management meetings.

## ⚡ The Problem & Solution

**The Problem:** Traditional cloud auto-scaling is *reactive*—it adds servers only after a traffic spike occurs, causing lag and latency. Additionally, idle VMs ("zombie servers") continue to run during low-traffic periods, inflating the cloud bill.

**The Solution:** This project introduces a *predictive* approach. By using time-series forecasting (Facebook Prophet) on historical telemetry data, the system anticipates traffic spikes hours in advance. It scales resources proactively and identifies idle nodes for termination, achieving true **FinOps optimization**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **🔮 Time-Series Forecasting:** High-accuracy workload prediction using Facebook Prophet to capture seasonality and traffic trends.
* **💸 Automated FinOps Screener:** Continuous monitoring of instance saturation to identify and flag zombie servers for cost-saving termination.
* **🚀 Proactive Scaling:** Replaces reactive lag with proactive provisioning by generating actionable scale-in and scale-out triggers.
* **📊 Live Telemetry Dashboard:** A Single Pane of Glass (SPOG) UI built with asynchronous JS and Chart.js for real-time visualization without UI blocking.
* **🔒 Decoupled REST API:** A secure, lightweight Flask backend using SQLAlchemy to map DB objects and prevent SQL injection.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

This project follows a strict **3-Tier Decoupled Architecture**:

1. **Model Layer (MLOps):** Prophet models are trained offline on Google Colab using the [Cloud Computing Performance Metrics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdurraziq01/cloud-computing-performance-metrics) from Kaggle, then serialized into binary `.pkl` files for ultra-fast, sub-millisecond inference.
2. **Controller Layer (Backend):** A Flask RESTful microservice acts as the bridge. It loads the `.pkl` files into RAM, queries the SQLite/MySQL database via SQLAlchemy, and serves JSON responses.
3. **Presentation Layer (Frontend):** The dashboard uses `fetch()` API calls asynchronously to render predictive metrics dynamically via Chart.js.

---

## 💻 Tech Stack

* **Data Science & ML:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Facebook Prophet
* **Dataset:** [Cloud Computing Performance Metrics (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdurraziq01/cloud-computing-performance-metrics)
* **Backend API:** Flask, SQLAlchemy (ORM)
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6), Chart.js
* **Database:** SQLite / MySQL
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab (for initial EDA and model training)
